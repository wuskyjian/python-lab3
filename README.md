# AmI 2018 - Lab 3: Python Intermediate

The goal of this set of exercises is to convert the third exercise of the previous laboratory (see [todo_manager_ex3.py](https://github.com/AmI-2018/python-lab2/tree/solution)) in a Telegram bot.

To get started:

1. Fork your own copy of this Git repository (_Fork_ button in the upper right corner of the GitHub repository webpage) to your personal account
2. Open PyCharm Professional on your computer and select _Checkout from Version Control > Git_ in the "Welcome to PyCharm" window, to clone your (forked) repository
3. Fill the requested fields (repository URL, location on disk, ...) and press the "Clone" button
4. Once the project is open, you can create a new Python file by right clicking on the project name (Project tab, on the left) and selecting _New > Python File_
5. To execute your program, right click on the Python file (in the Project tab) to be executed and select _Run_
6. Commit and push the changes you made back to GitHub, from the VCS menu in PyCharm
